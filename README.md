# stache

A Rails 3.x and Rails 4.x compatible Mustache/Handlebars template handler, with support for partials and a couple extra niceties to make sharing the raw templates with client-side javascript a little easier. It's a one-stop shop for your facial-hair-inspired templates.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/agoragames/stache.png)](http://travis-ci.org/agoragames/stache)

## 1.0.3

If you want Rails 4, you'll have to use 1.0.3.

## 1.0.0

Major overhaul to the mustache side of things. Backwards compatibility *should* be intact. If not, file a bug and it will get taken care of.

Handlebars can also handle application layouts, and you can use subclasses of Stache::Handlebars::View to define view-specific helpers now.

## Notice Of Breaking Changes

Stache 0.9.x adds handlebars support. In the process, the public API has changed *ever-so-slightly*. Specifically, you'll need to require the mustache or handlebars gems on your own, **and** you'll need to tell Stache which one (or both!) you want to use. Add `config.use :mustache` to your initializer.

## Usage

    gem "mustache" # or "handlebars"
    gem "stache"

Install the gem. If you want to override any of the configuration options (see `stache/config`), toss an initializer in `config/initializers` and:

```ruby
Stache.configure do |c|
  # This is probably the one you'll want to change
  # it defaults to app/templates
  c.template_base_path = "..."

  # This lets you indicate the name of a module that
  # namespaces all your view classes, useful, if you
  # have a naming conflict, such as with a mailer
  c.wrapper_module_name = "..."

  # N.B. YOU MUST TELL STACHE WHICH TO USE:
  c.use :mustache
  # and / or
  c.use :handlebars

  # Set it to true if template path should be included in
  # script's id tag as a underscored prefix. It can be
  # overwritten by an id param in `#template_include_path`.
  c.include_path_in_id = false
end

# or if the block style ain't yer thang, just:
Stache.template_base_path = File.join(Rails.root, "app", "ÅŸablon")
```

There is as of right now one provided helper, `template_include_tag`. Give it the name of a partial and it will write it raw to a script block.

## A View Class of your Very Own

To facilitate easy integration, 'Stache comes packaged with a fully-functioning subclass of Mustache, called `Stache::Mustache::View`. It will try to find a more appropriate view class to provide to the template renderer based on the template name, but if one cannot be found it will automatically give ya a `Stache::Mustache::View` so you can have *something*.

Needless to say, it's probably better if your custom View objects are subclasses of `Stache::Mustache::View`. That way we can all be sure that the handler will render correctly.

An example by way of explanation:

With a template `app/templates/profiles/index`, Stache will look for a view named `Profiles::Index`, and, if not found, will just use the base `Stache::Mustache::View`. Stache adds `app/views` to Rails' autoload paths, so here's a sample directory structure and some sample files:

```
app/
  templates/
    profiles/
      index.html.mustache
  views/
    profiles/
      index.rb
```

```ruby
# in profiles/index.rb
module Profiles
  class Index < ::Stache::Mustache::View
    def my_view_helper_method
      "whoo"
    end
  end
end
```

```html
<!-- in the view, then -->
<p>Here's a helper_method call: {{ my_view_helper_method }}</p>
```

With the wrapper_module_name configuration set to "Wrapper":

With a template `app/templates/profiles/index`, Stache will look for a view named `Wrapper::Profiles::Index`, and, if not found, will just use the base `Stache::Mustache::View`.

### Handlebars?

Handlebars will have full access to your rails view helpers.

```
I'm a handlebars template. Look at me call a helper: {{{image_path my_image}}}
```

You can subclass `Stache::Handlebars::View` in the same way as mustache above, but there isn't as much point in doing so.

## View Specs

Yes, you can write view specs using RSpec for your Stache templates! You can use RSpec's `assign` method to
assign values to view instance variables, which will then be be available to the Stache view, either as
instance variables, or via an accessor. Any instance variables defined in the RSpec example will also be
similarly available, so

```ruby
    it "should display my instance variable" do
      assign(:resource, "Foo")
      render
      ...
    end
```
and

```ruby
    it "should display my instance variable" do
      @resource = "Foo"
      render
      ...
    end
```
both make `@resource` available to the Stache view.

## Non-Mustache Partials

Yes, you can include non-Mustache partials (and templates) in your Stache templates. However, the
`{{>partial_name_here}}` syntax in the template won't find a non-Mustache template. You can define
a method in the view and reference it in the template. The view method should use `@view.render` to
render the non-Mustache partial and return its content. Example:

Mustache template:

```
    {{{my_haml_sidebar}}}
```

View:

```ruby
   class MyPage < ::Stache::Mustache::View
     def my_haml_sidebar
       @view.render partial: 'somewhere/some_haml_partial_name'
     end
   end
```

## Of Note

This is code that was ripped out of a research project. It probably has some rough edges.

## Thanks to

This project builds on work done by the following people and projects:

* olivernn's [Poirot](https://github.com/olivernn/poirot)
* goodmike's [mustache_rails3](https://github.com/goodmike/mustache_rails3)
* nex3's [HAML](https://github.com/nex3/haml)
* cowboyd's [handlebars.rb](https://github.com/cowboyd/handlebars.rb)

So: thanks a ton to those guys.

## Contributors

* [afeld](https://github.com/afeld) provided 1.8.7 compatibility fixes.
* [subwindow](https://github.com/subwindow) provided some much needed love for Stache::Mustache::View exception handling.
* [solotimes](https://github.com/solotimes) provided better support for non-standard encodings.
* [ajacksified](https://github.com/ajacksified) cleaned up template extension handling.
* [ayamomiji](https://github.com/ayamomiji) extended the `#template_include_tag` to pass through the full range of `#content_tag` options.
* [awestendorf](https://github.com/awestendorf) requested that `View#partial` not be so particular about leading underscores. Though I didn't use his code, his prompt lead me to investigate how to properly use Rails' internal template lookup code.
* [zombor](https://github.com/zombor) contributed an overhaul to the Mustache renderer that puts Mustache classes themselves in control of the render chain, not Rails.
* [kategengler](https://github.com/kategengler) contributed a patch to allow folks to specify a namespace for their view objects.
* [joker1007](https://github.com/joker1007) contributed a patch making the autoload paths setup more broadly compatible.

Thanks a ton to all of the contributors as well. This would never have grown beyond a mediocre tool that rendered partials without their help!

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
